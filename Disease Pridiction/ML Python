# Predictive Modeling for Disease Diagnosis
## Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify individuals into
diseased or non-diseased categories based on their health attributes. By leveraging machine learning
algorithms, we aim to create a reliable tool that healthcare providers can use to assist in disease
diagnosis and prognosis.
